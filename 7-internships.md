# Internships

Your second year is the ideal time to start applying for internships. By now, you've likely completed foundational courses like data structures and algorithms, which qualify you for many technical roles. You’re also still eligible for early-career programs designed for first- and second-year students. This gives you access to a broad range of opportunities, making this year better than any other point in your degree.

## Apply Early

Internship applications can open as early as the summer before the summer internship you intend to do. Starting early is critical; even with a strong resumé (see our [Resumé Guide](./second-year-guide/8-building-your-resume)), you may need to apply to hundreds of roles before getting an offer. Avoid burnout by spreading your applications over time and not cramming them into the last minute.

Stay organized with a spreadsheet or use tools like [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/) or [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to track applications, deadlines, and statuses. And again, **submit as early as possible**.

## Apply Everywhere

Don’t limit yourself. You *can* land an internship at a top-tier company (Google, Meta, Shopify, NVIDIA, etc.) even in your second year. In fact, many large companies have **dedicated early-career programs** that prioritize second-year students. A good example is this [GitHub Internship List](https://github.com/codicate/underclassmen-internships), which is regularly updated and curated. You should always be on the lookout for such resources, possibly on LinkedIn or GitHub.

## Network

Networking is one of the most powerful tools in your internship search. Whether it’s through **LinkedIn**, **career fairs**, or conferences like [CUSEC](https://2025.cusec.net/), building real connections with professionals, recruiters, and alumni can give you a serious edge. You don’t need to be pushy; just be curious, respectful, and consistent.

Follow up after conversations, comment on posts, and don’t be afraid to message people who work at companies you admire. You’ll be surprised at how many are happy to help.

## Broaden Your Search

Internships aren’t the only way to gain experience. You can also apply to:

- **Teaching roles**: Become a [Stanford Code in Place Section Leader](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/)
- **Research opportunities**: Explore different research labs, apply for the [URA](https://umanitoba.ca/research/opportunities-support/undergraduate-research-awards) and [USRA](https://umanitoba.ca/science/research/undergraduate-research/usra), and work with professors throughout the summer.
- **Open-source contributions** — check out projects on [GitHub’s Good First Issues](https://github.com/search?q=good+first+issue) or participate in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

All of these strengthen your resumé, give you experience, and set you apart from other candidates.

## Search & Apply Smarter

Use curated internship repositories like [PittCSC's GitHub list](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2025-Internships), job boards like [LinkedIn Jobs](https://linkedin.com/jobs), [Wellfound](https://wellfound.com/), and [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) to discover roles you may not hear about otherwise.

If you can get a **referral**, that’s a huge plus. LinkedIn is a great place to reach out. But even without one, you can stand out with a strong, tailored cover letter.

## Ace the Interview

Your interview is a chance to showcase who you are beyond the resumé. To prepare:

- Study the **job description** carefully
- Research the company and its recent work or initiatives
- Practice coding questions (try [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/) or [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/))
- Use [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/) or mock interview with a friend to improve

During the interview, stay calm, listen closely, and don’t be afraid to take a moment before answering. Always ask thoughtful questions and treat the interview like a conversation.

## Final Thoughts

Lastly, life doesn’t always turn out the way we plan it to. Not being able to land an internship in your second year isn’t the end of the world, and you shouldn’t be too tough on yourself for it. Sometimes luck wouldn’t be in your favor and that's okay. Not getting an internship in your second year doesn’t mean you’ve failed. Hiring is unpredictable, and even the most qualified candidates get rejected.

Stay consistent, keep learning, and trust the process. Your persistence will pay off and when it does, you’ll be ready.
