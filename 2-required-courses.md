**MUST BE UPDATED AGAIN AFTER ACADEMIC CALENDAR 2025-2026 IS RELEASED**

## Outline

### Must-take (BSc CS, BCSc CS)

- Fall:
  - COMP 2140 (requires COMP 1020, should do 1240 anyway)
  - COMP 2400 (requires COMP 1020 + STAT 1150)
  - COMP 2450 (requires COMP 1020)
- Winter:
  - COMP 2080 (requires COMP 2140 + MATH 1240)
  - COMP 2280 (requires COMP 2140 + MATH 1240) (recheck if others are needed later)
  - COMP 2452 (requires COMP 2400 + COMP 2452)

### Joint CS-MATH

  - don't do 5
  - for CS-related coop, CS courses are more valuable than MATH courses

### Joint CS-PHYS

consult other people

### Joint CS-STAT

research more later

research more later



###########################################################################################################
The second year of the Computer Science program typically includes a greater number of core Computer Science courses compared to the first year. Assuming you have already declared your major as Computer Science, this section of the guide outlines a recommended course plan and highlights the required courses you must successfully complete to progress in your degree and unlock key upper-year courses.

# 📘 Recommended Course Plan – Year 2 (Computer Science)

Assuming you’ve completed all your Year 1 core requirements, here’s a suggested guide to help you succeed in Year 2 of a Computer Science Major/Honours program.

## ✅ Core Year 2 Courses

You’ll want to take the following six COMP courses in your second year:

- **COMP 2140** – Data Structures  
- **COMP 2080** – Algorithms  
- **COMP 2400** – Programming Paradigms  
- **COMP 2450** – Software Development 1  
- **COMP 2452** – Software Development 2  
- **COMP 2280** – Introduction to Computer Systems  

> ⚠️ All courses require a **minimum grade of C** to count toward your degree.

### 🔄 Prerequisites Flow

- `COMP 1020` → `COMP 2140` → `COMP 2080`, `COMP 2280`  
- `COMP 2140` + `MATH 1240` → `COMP 2080`, `COMP 2280`  
- `COMP 2400` + `COMP 2450` → `COMP 2452`

### 🟧 Maximized Schedule (Aggressive)

Recommended **only** if you did very well in Year 1 and are aiming for Joint Honours or early research opportunities.

| Fall        | Winter        | Summer                       |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------         |
| COMP 2140   | COMP 2080     | COMP 3380 / Co-op / Research |
| COMP 2400   | COMP 2452     |                              |
| COMP 2450   | COMP 2280     |                              |
| Elective    | Elective      |                              |

> ⚠️ This is an intense workload. Avoid if GPA was below 3.5 in Year 1.

---

### 🟥 Extended Schedule (Protect GPA)

Designed for students who struggled with Year 1 math/programming or want a lighter load.

| Fall        | Winter        | Summer       |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| COMP 2140   | COMP 2450     | COMP 2080    |

| Elective    | Elective      |              |

- Gives more time to digest heavy concepts.
- Useful if MATH 1240 was difficult.

---

## 💡 Final Advice for Computer Science Honours or Major 

- ✅ **Start with COMP 2140**: It unlocks most Year 2 courses.
- ✅ Take **MATH 1240** before or with COMP 2080/2280.
- 📈 **Prioritize GPA** over speed; retaking courses delays graduation more than going slow.
- 📅 Plan for Year 3: Many COMP 3000+ courses require COMP 2080 and 2140.
- 📊 Consider **MATH 2720** (Multivariable Calc) or **MATH 2130** (Discrete Math) for extra prep or Joint Honours.

💡 COMP 2140 is essential to unlock most other COMP courses — take it early.

📐 MATH 2080 → MATH 2150 is the required analysis track for statistics and computing.

🧠 STAT 2400 is your introduction to probability theory — crucial for upper-level stats work.

🧪 COMP 2452 depends on both COMP 2400 and 2450, so plan those carefully.

🎯 Keep track of mutually exclusive courses and GPA requirements for Honours standing.
