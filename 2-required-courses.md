# Recommended Course Plan

Congraluations on having declared your program in Computer Science! Unlike in first year where you may have been at risk of losing your first-week registration privileges if you took too long, here you're equals with every other non-first years, so take your time! Here’s a suggested guide to help you succeed in Year 2 of a Computer Science Major/Honours program. We have schedules for all Computer Science (including Joint) programs and the Data Science program; read on to find yours!

## Courses

### COMP Core

There are, in total, six core COMP courses in second year:

- Fall:
  - **COMP 2140** – Data Structures: Analysis and Implementation (requires: COMP 1020)
  - **COMP 2400** – Programming Paradigms (requires: COMP 1020 + STAT 1150)
  - **COMP 2450** – Software Development 1 (requires: COMP 1020)
- Winter:
  - **COMP 2080** – Algorithms: Analysis and Implementation (requires: COMP 2140 + MATH 1240)
  - **COMP 2280** – Introduction to Computer Systems (requires: COMP 2140 + COMP 2400 + MATH 1240)
  - **COMP 2452** – Software Development 2 (requires: COMP 2400 + COMP 2450)

> ⚠️ All courses require a **minimum grade of C** to count toward your degree.

Different degrees, however, require different courses. Here's a quick reference table for what courses you may not need:

|Required|COMP 2080|COMP 2140|COMP 2280|COMP 2400|COMP 2450|COMP 2452|
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|CS Major|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|CS Honours|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|CS + Math Joint|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|
|CS + Physics Joint|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|
|CS + Stats Joint|No|Yes|No|Yes|Yes|Yes|

### COMP Options

You also have other COMP options you can try, if you've already completed some core in Summer or have credits to spare:

- COMP 2600 (Technical Communication in Computer Science): Offered in Winter, this course teaches you the tools and techniques necessary to be an effective communicator in Computer Science. If the programming standards you learned in first year aren't enough to convince you, being able to communicate well beats being able to code fast every time! You also learn genuinely useful, job-applicable tools such as Git, static site generators, and OpenAPI.
- COMP 1002 + 1006 (Introduction to Tools and Techniques in Computer Science): You learn useful tools that you probably wish you knew in first year, if you haven't taken these courses already. They're worth only 3 credits altogether. You can peep at the textbook [here](https://toolsntechniques.ca/)!
- COMP 2002 + 2006 (Tools and Techniques in Computer Scinece): The latest iteration of these also 1.5 crs lab courses had you explore Python, Lisp, C and Go as programming languages and comparing and contrasting them to Java. Diversity in knowledge means more resume bullet points and makes you a better computer scientist!
- COMP 1600 (Navigating Your Digital World): If you haven't taken this already in first year, it is a good overview on how digitalization has shaped our world. As you're furthering your education to become a well-rounded computer scientist, you should be aware of the effect your field has on humanity at large. This course is also a spiritual precursor to COMP 4620, a mandatory course you'll have to take in the future.
- COMP 3490 (Computer Graphics 1): While this course normally requires COMP 2452, another alternative prerequisite path is COMP 2140 + any MATH 2XXX course. If you're interested in Graphics, consider doing a second-year MATH course in Fall and taking this Winter!
- Any other courses you have the prerequisites for and are interested in!

If you did COMP 2140 in Summer, depending on whether you do COMP 2080 early in the same Summer or Fall, you may also have a crack at COMP 3030 in Fall and COMP 3170 in Winter.

### Electives

Outside of COMP courses, you can also begin thinking about electives and minors to supplement your degree. We have a lot to say on this; refer to [Elective and Minors](./3-electives-and-minors.md) for the full detail.

However, do make sure that, in your first **60 credit hours**, you:
- Complete 6 crs worth of Faculty of Arts courses
- Complete a 3 crs W (Writing) course
These requirements are not mutually exclusive. If you followed our First Year Guide, you likely have already finished one W Arts course, and you'll only need one more. Regardless, you should probably get these over with in your second year. Schedules get less flexible from here!

---

Let's move on to the actual schedules!

## Computer Science Honours/Major

| Fall        | Winter        | Summer (optional)      |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| COMP 2140   | COMP 2080     | COMP 3XXX              |
| COMP 2400   | COMP 2452     |                        |
| COMP 2450   | COMP 2280     |                        |
| Elective    | Elective      |                        |

Not much else to say here; there are 6 courses you're expected to complete, and you must have completed every first year course already if you're in the program. It's just padding on extra electives or higher-level courses if you feel like it.

### If you haven't completed STAT 1150

| Fall        | Winter        | Summer (if offered)    |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| COMP 2140   | COMP 2080     | COMP 2280              |
| STAT 1150   | COMP 2400     | COMP 2452              |
| COMP 2450   | Elective      |                        |
| Elective    | Elective      |                        |

**Note**: We don't know if and when COMP 2452 will be offered in Summer; this is just a suggestion. It's likely that you'll have to push the course to your third year and not qualify for Co-op after finishing Winter. In that case, if you want to maximize your Co-op chance, consider taking 3 courses so you don't accumulate too many credit hours. More details can be found in our later section "The Co-op Program".

### If you completed some core courses in Summer

- COMP 2140: You can take COMP 2080 in Fall. COMP 2080 is generally regarded as a hard course, so doing so allows you to retake it in Winter if necessary. If you finish COMP 2080 in Fall, you can consider doing COMP 3170 in Winter if you're considering Honours.
- COMP 2080: If you had the type of Summer where you took both data structures and algorithms courses, congratulations! Your term should be much lighter. If you want to keep up the pace and are considering Honours, COMP 3030 in Fall and COMP 3170 in Winter are courses you can get out of the way early.

### If you're in COMP 2160 + 2150 limbo (2025 - 2026 term only)

> This is for the students who have already begun taking second year courses since Winter 2025.

- If you haven't completed COMP 2160 by now: Take COMP 2400 + 2450 in Fall and COMP 2452 in Winter to sync up with the new second years, and any other second year COMP courses you haven't completed already.
- If you have completed COMP 2160 but not 2150: **Take the last COMP 2150 section in Fall**. Complete other second year COMP courses if you haven't already. If you're unable to take the Fall 2150, contact an academic advisor, as you'll likely need to deprecate your COMP 2160 credits so you can take COMP 2400 + 2450 + 2452 alongside future second years.
- If you've completed COMP 2160 + 2150: Finish the rest of your second year courses. All other advices regarding course selection apply.

💡 COMP 2140 is essential to unlock most other COMP courses — take it early.

📐 MATH 2080 → MATH 2150 is the required analysis track for statistics and computing.

🧠 STAT 2400 is your introduction to probability theory — crucial for upper-level stats work.

🧪 COMP 2452 depends on both COMP 2400 and 2450, so plan those carefully.

🎯 Keep track of mutually exclusive courses and GPA requirements for Honours standing.
