During your first year in Computer Science, you're usually focused on finding your footing. You're adjusting to university life, managing a heavy course load, and learning the basics of programming, math, and statistics. With all of that going on, it’s completely normal not to have your career path figured out yet.

But by the second year, things often start to click. You begin to notice which parts of Computer Science you’re actually interested in. Maybe you really enjoy *Object Orientation*, or maybe theoretical courses like _Analysis of Algorithms_ make more sense to you. You might like building interfaces, working with data, or understanding how systems work behind the scenes.

Now is a good time to start thinking about your **interests and strengths**, and how they might shape your future studies and career goals.

You don’t need to have all the answers yet. But if you're still figuring things out, ask yourself:

- *Do I like working alone or in a team?*
- *Do I enjoy building new things, fixing systems, or improving existing ones?*
- *Do I feel more satisfied starting from scratch or improving what already exists?*
- *What courses have I enjoyed most, and why?*

## Possible Career Paths

Below is a curated list of key focus areas within Computer Science, along with detailed descriptions of the kinds of roles and career paths you might explore in each category. 

> **Note:** Job titles can vary significantly between companies, and the responsibilities associated with a title like _Software Developer_ or _Data Analyst_ might look very different depending on the context.

This guide is meant to give you a starting point for exploring what kinds of opportunities align with your interests, especially as you start to notice which courses, projects, or topics you gravitate toward during your time in university.

### Development-Oriented Roles

Consider this path if you’re especially drawn to courses with a strong programming focus. These roles are centred around writing, testing, and maintaining code, and often will involve working within a team. 

These careers are a great fit for people who enjoy the hands-on creation of software, seeing their code come to life, and improving the reliability and performance of different programs. 

| Role                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Software Developer**                                | Builds desktop or mobile applications. Could be system-level or application-level.                                                                                   |
| **Web Developer**                                     | Works on websites and web apps. Might specialize in front-end (user interface) or back-end (data/server logic).                                                      |
| **Game Developer**                                    | Creates games using engines like Unity or Unreal. Often combines logic, physics, and storytelling. Note: Don't choose this path *just* because you like video games. |
| **Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Engineer** | Trains and deploys models that can classify, generate, or predict based on data. Heavy math and experimentation.                                                     |
| **DevOps Engineer**                                   | Bridge development and operations by writing code for automation, deployment, and infrastructure.                                                                    |
**Signs this may be for you:**
- You enjoy solving technical challenges and debugging.
- You like building apps or tools from scratch.
- You’ve completed personal projects or enjoyed hackathons.
- You’re curious about how code works under the hood.
