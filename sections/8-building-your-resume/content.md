# Building your Resume

Author: Ray, Peter

## Content

- Supplemental guides:
  - utoronto dcs
  - career services
- TL;DR
  - One page for serious internship/job applications, 2-pager fine for co-op/sending professors
  - Header -> Education -> Skills (for tech job) -> (Relevant) Work Experience -> Projects/Extracurricular Activities if relevant
    - Highly situational: Awards, Languages, Interests
  - Specific what-to-put in sections:
    - Header:
      - Must-haves: Name, phone, email, and if you have them (LinkedIn, GitHub, Website)
      - DO NOT PUT YOUR FUCKING ADDRESS (unless it's local job)
    - Education:
      - Must-haves: Degree, University, Duration (**WITH EXPECTED GRADUATION**)
      - Situational: GPA (if it's good), relevant courses, scholarships/awards
    - Skills (for tech jobs):
      - Section them (e.g. Languages, Frameworks/Libraries, Tools)
      - Keep relevant skills to job at first
    - Work Experience:
      - RELEVANT, exclude irrelevant ones if possible
      - Must-have: Position title, company, duration (- Now if still working), location
      - Bullet point descriptions: XYZ format (give examples)
      - Order by most recent to least
    - Extracurricular activities is same as work experience, use when not enough relevant work experience (soft skills matter)
    - Projects (for tech jobs or whatever that projects (e.g. essays) would look good on):
      - Must-have: Project name
      - Situational: Time, occasion (e.g. hackathon), won some competition or whatever
      - List out technologies used either in heading or in descriptions
      - Socially impactful projects (i.e. actual userbase) >> technically complex project + collaboration > technically complex project > simple project
      - Bullet point descriptions: XYZ for impactful projects, and technical jargon (that is reasonable)
