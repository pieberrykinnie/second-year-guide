# The Co-op Program  
Co-operative Education integrates academic studies with paid work experience, providing hands-on learning in industry, government, or research settings. As a cornerstone of the Faculty of Science, this program helps you apply classroom knowledge while building professional networks.  


## Reality Check

In most guides, people would just go straight into prescribing what Co-op is all about and what the application process looks like, which we do right after this! **However**, we believe it is very, very important that anyone even remotely interested in Co-op listens to these words first, and thus we can't risk people skipping it by not reading until the end of the page.

Do you *need* Co-op to get a job when you graduate? No. Not even close.

Would you, as a normal University of Manitoba Computer Science student, benefit from at least *trying* to apply to the Co-op program, and trying to finish 3 work terms in Co-op, be it professionally, academically, or employment-wise? *Yes*, possibly all of the time, unless you're a true high-achiever who has a proven ability to land your own internships comfortably.

Co-op isn't anything but a university-owned *program* with industry partnerships thats link high-performing, job ready students and partner companies in demand of computer scientists together, for the mutual benefit of both. Getting into Co-op doesn't mean you'll get a job when you graduate. Conversely, not getting into Co-op doesn't mean you're not worthy of internships.

Co-op isn't your magical savior from unemployment, either. They have demands that when you meet, you benefit the program too. One thing that is significantly different from applying for Co-op postings and applying for internships on your own is that *you can only reject a maximum of one offer per term*. It's easy to see from their side why this happens, and thus they can't really be blamed for this, but factor in how you're competing with ~80 other students and companies put up their job postings during different times, and what often happens is that some students may be forced to take the jobs they didn't really want or some employers may be forced to pick students that weren't the best out of that cohort.

For the record, the CSSA loves and recommends the Co-op program and many generations of our executive team have developed greatly through the opportunities provided by the Co-op office! However, we believe it is in your best interest as a student to have a nuanced perspective over blindly going "they help me get jobs, therefore they good". We encourage you to read this blog criticizing Carleton University's CS Co-op program by Matthew MacRae-Bovell [here](https://matthewmacraebovell.com/blog/carleton-cs-coop-explained/). While there are differences between their program and ours, most people you talk to won't really criticize Co-op as a concept, and thus a second perspective will help you make informed decisions for your future.

## Program Overview  
### Core Structure  
- **Work terms**: Three 4-month placements (minimum 12 weeks each).  
- **Schedule**: Alternates academic terms with work terms during Years 3–5.  
  > *Example pathway:*  
  > - Year 3: Fall (Courses) → Winter (Work Term 1) → Summer (Courses)  
  > - Year 4: Fall (Work Term 2) → Winter (Courses) → Summer (Work Term 3)  
- **Custom streams**: International/Joint Honours students develop individualized plans with coordinators.

**IMPORTANT!** If you're an incoming second year reading this in Summer, contact the Co-op office **NOW!**. Your first work term is expected to be Summer 2nd Year, far earlier than non-Joint Honours; thus, you'll be applying off-stream to everyone else, most of the time.
